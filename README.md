# Introduction
  Welcome to "Quick Bites." This is an app I created for people who might not have the time to make tasty meals. In this app, are some quick meal ideas that take an hour or less to make. The cards include the name of the dish, the ingredients you will need, the meal prep/cook time, and a tutorial link in case you want to see how it is done.
